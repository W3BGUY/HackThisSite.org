  Message: Hey man, I need a big favour from you. Remember that website I showed you once before? Uncle Arnold's Band Review Page? Well, a long time 
    ago I made a $500 bet with a friend that my band would be at the top of the list by the end of the year. Well, as you already know, two of my band 
    members have died in a horrendous car accident... but this ass hole still insists that the bet is on!
    I know you're good with computers and stuff, so I was wondering, is there any way for you to hack this website and make my band on the top of the 
    list? My band is Raging Inferno. Thanks a lot, man!
  
  
Solution:
  We are presented with a forum type site that has voting options on it, for numerous bands.  My first thought is to edit the value of the vote input, for the 
  needed band, and then vote.  I changed the #5 vote to a 100, and hit the vote button.  
  
  That looks to be the solution, as it provided me with a success. :)
