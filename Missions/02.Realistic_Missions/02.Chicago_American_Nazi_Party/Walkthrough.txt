  Message: I have been informed that you have quite admirable hacking skills. Well, this racist hate group is using their website to organize a mass 
    gathering of ignorant racist bastards. We cannot allow such bigoted aggression to happen. If you can gain access to their administrator page and post 
    messages to their main page, we would be eternally grateful.


Solution:
  Initially provided with a basic blog type page, with no obvious links.  Looking at the page source, is the first step.
  At the bottom of the page there is a hidden link to the update.php page.  Let's go there.
  
  The update.php page takes us to a login page, asking for a username and password.  Nothing obvious in the source.  This pagesends the username and password to the 
  update2.php page.  Navigating directly there returns a invalid message.
  
  Next I tried entering in a BS password, thought I did not see anything special about how it is sent.  So let's try a basic SQL injection on the fields.
  I entered the following in both the username and password fields:
  
    ' OR '1'='1
    
  Success.  That gets me through to the next mission.
