Description:
  Peace Poetry: HACKED
  A little girl made a website to post poetry related to peace and understanding. American fascists have hacked this website replacing it with Hitler-esque 
  propaganda. Can you repair the website? 
  Difficulty rating: Moderate.
  
  From: PeacePoetry 

  Message: I run this website where people can read and submit peace-related poetry. I am doing this out of good will towards others, and I 
    don't see why I would be making enemies out of this, but some real ass hole hacked my website posting a bunch of ignorant aggressive propaganda 
    on the front page. And I made that website a while ago, and I no longer have access to it. Do you think you can hack in and change it back? Please? 
    Oh, and bonus points if you message me the name of the bastard who did this!
    
    
Solution:
  We are initially presented with a page that has obviously been hacked.  I checked out the page source as a first step and found the following comment on it.
  
    <!--Note to the webmasterThis website has been hacked, but not totally destroyed. The old website is still up. I simply copied the old index.html file to 
    oldindex.html and remade this one. Sorry about the inconvenience.-->
  
  As expected, loading oldindex.html does show the original page, including links to read the poetry and submit poetry.
  
  My thought is to try and create a new poem titled index.html, with the source in it.  That did not work, though.  At least not exactly like that...
