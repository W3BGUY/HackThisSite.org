  Decrypt the password and enter it below to advance to the next level.

Solution:
  As a test I entered aaaaa into the encrypter.  It returned abcde.  So each letter is incremented by the number of characters equal to it's current position in the string.
  
    aaaaa
    01234
    abcde
    
    So to decrypt the password, we should just need to reverse that process.
    
    0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

    01234567

    Return to the main page and enter the password.
