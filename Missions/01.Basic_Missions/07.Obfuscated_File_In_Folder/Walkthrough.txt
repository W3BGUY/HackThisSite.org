Description:
  The password is hidden in an unknown file, and Sam has set up a script to display a calendar. Requirements: Basic UNIX command knowledge.
  
  This time Network Security sam has saved the unencrypted level7 password in an obscurely named file saved in this very directory.
  In other unrelated news, Sam has set up a script that returns the output from the UNIX cal command. Here is the script:
  Enter the year you wish to view and hit 'view'.

Solution:
  Since Sam is using a file in the current directory, we need to see what files are in the directory.  The field that returns the results of the UNIX Cal command
  provides us with the opening.  Hitting the view button without anything in the field returns the following:

        Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun
                      1   2   3   4
          5   6   7   8   9  10  11
         12  13  14  15  16  17  18
         19  20  21  22  23  24  25
         26  27  28  29  30  31

  UNIX commands are ended and concatenated with the ; character.  So, my first thought is to just enter
    ; ls
  into the field and hit view.  That returns the following:

         12  13  14  15  16  17  18
         19  20  21  22  23  24  25
         26  27  28  29  30  31
        
        
        .
        ..
        
        cal.pl
        index.php
        k1kh31b1n55h.php
        level7.php
    
  Now we have the file name.  I try loading that page and I receive the password:  cd20917e
  
  Return to the main page and enter the password now.
