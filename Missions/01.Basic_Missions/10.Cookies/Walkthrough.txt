Description:
  This time Sam used a more temporary and "hidden" approach to authenticating users, but he didn't think about whether or not those users knew their way around javascript...
  
  Enter password.  Please enter a password to gain access to level 10.
  
Solution:
  This level has no information, so my first thought is to see what's in the directory using level 8.  So I run the following command there.
    <!--#exec cmd="../../10" -->
    
  This returns the following information:
    If you are trying to use server side includes to solve the challenge, you are on the right track: but I have limited the commands allowed to 
    ones relevant towards finding the password file for security reasons(because there will always be that one person who decides to execute 
    some rather nasty commands). So please manipulate your code so that it is a little more pertaining to the level.
    
  So this level does not use that method.  Next thought is to check the page source for clues.  Which I did not find.
  Next I tried some SQL injection on the field by entering the following options:
    # OR 1=1 --
    ' OR '1'='1
    ' OR '1'='1' --
    ' OR '1'='1' /*
  
  None of those worked either.  My next thought was to look at the cookies on the site.  That's where I found the solution.  There is a cookie called: 
    level10_authorized
  The default value of the cookie is: no
  I changed that to yes, and entered some random data into the password field, and was allowed to enter.
