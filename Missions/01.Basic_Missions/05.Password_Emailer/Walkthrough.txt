Description:
  Similar to the previous challenge, but with some extra security measures in place. Requirements: HTML knowledge, JS or FF, an email address.
  
  Sam has gotten wise to all the people who wrote their own forms to get the password. Rather than actually learn the password, he decided to make his 
  email program a little more secure.
  
Solution:
  View page source.  Notice the hidden input field with Sam's email address hard-coded.  Edit the local HTML and enter your password.  Then hit the 
  Send password to Sam button.  You should see a confirmation page, and an email with the password in it.
  
    Sam,
    Here is the password: '62a338b3'.
  
  Return to the main page and enter the password.
