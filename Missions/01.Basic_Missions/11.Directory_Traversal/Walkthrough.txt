Description:
  Sam decided to make a music site. Unfortunately he does not understand Apache. This mission is a bit harder than the other basics.
  
  I love my music! "Come Down in Time" is the best!
  
Solution:
  This level starts off with just the text above, and no clues.  My first thought is to check the page source again.  That reveals this hint:
    <!--We even have our own collection - if you could find it!-->
  
  That hint makes me think we need directory traversal.  I checked for a robots.txt file, and a .htaccess file.  Neither worked, but the text on the page keeps changing with
  each reload.
    I love my music! "Heart in the Right Place" is the best!
    I love my music! "Sleeping with the Past" is the best!
    I love my music! "Candle in the Wind" is the best!
  
  After a couple of Google searches, I see that each song that comes up is by Elton John.  I tried a couple of different sub directories:
    elton
    eltonjohn
    elton_john
    e
  
  The last one returned the directory listing.  There I now see the Parent directory and an l directory.
  Moving to the l directory shows the parent directory and t.  At this point it looks like I'll be spelling out Elton John as directories.
  I've now made it to the https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/11/e/l/t/o/n/ and there are no more sub directories listed.
  
  I return to the main directory and start trying robots.txt and .htaccess in each directory.
  Once I get back to the e/l/t/o/n directory .htaccess is not protected and returns the following information:
  
    IndexIgnore DaAnswer.* .htaccess
    <Files .htaccess>
    order allow,deny
    allow from all
    </Files>
  
  The next obvious try is the ignored DaAnswer directory/file.  https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/11/e/l/t/o/n/DaAnswer/ returns:
    The answer is around! Just look a little harder.
  
  Since the rest has been simple once I found my way to a hint, I tried using around as the password at the index.php page.  That turned out to be the correct password.
