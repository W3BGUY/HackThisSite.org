Description:
  A slightly more difficult challenge, involving an incomplete password script. Requirements: Common sense.
  
  Network Security Sam set up a password protection script. He made it load the real password from an unencrypted text file and compare it to the 
  password the user enters. However, he neglected to upload the password file...
  
Solution:
  There is no password file to use, thus there is no password.  Just hit the submit button.
